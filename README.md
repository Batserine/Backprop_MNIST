# Backprop_MNIST
Simple neural network built with numpy to see classification metrics.
1. Choosing a small number of training inputs in each batch, and processes the error for each sample is accumulated. 
2. Invoke the back propagation following this.
3. Classify the predictions using confusion matrix.

## Confusion matrix:
